The key point in the given instruction is to improve the output, which in this context means to adjust the action in order to make better progress towards achieving the goal. However, because the feedback already indicates a positive outcome from the current action, it suggests that the action is leading towards the goal, but it may not be optimized. To further optimize, one needs to analyze the observation and the goal position, extracting relevant parts to adjust the action dynamically. This would typically involve processing observations and calculating a more precise set of actions to minimize the distance to the goal, possibly increasing the reward and efficiency. Nevertheless, without specific feedback on what aspect needs improvement (faster convergence, higher reward, avoiding obstacles, etc.), it's difficult to propose a specific change. To propose a generic improvement without altering the goal or known desired output, we could theorize enhancing action calculation to be more dynamic, considering the current 'hand_pos' and 'goal_pos'.\",\n",
